# Hi there,i'm Rebonye Keabetswe

I'm a **UX Designer turned Developer**, currently based in **Botswana** — passionate about designing seamless digital experiences and building systems that scale.  

My journey started in **UX and web design**, where I fell in love with creating products that are both beautiful and functional. Now, I’m expanding my skills into **full-stack development** and **DevOps engineering**, aiming to bridge the gap between design, code, and infrastructure.

## 🚀 About Me

🎯 My goal is to become a **DevOps-oriented UX Developer** who can take an idea from concept to deployment.  
🧩 I enjoy solving problems, learning new tools, and automating processes that make life easier for teams.
